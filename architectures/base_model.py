"""Abstract semantic segmentation model.

Defines a base class to be used by groups of semantic segmentation models in
the project. Any supporting scripts such as trainers, evaluators and
exporters should only call the methods defined in the abstract class.

The general order of using the models implementing this abstract class can be
as followed for both training and evaluation

Training flow:
inputs -> preprocess -> predict -> loss -> outputs
